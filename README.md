## What is excelsior ?

Excelsior is a project created from my work as a tester at Air France.
I notice that many of our work was not fully comprehensive and we needed a better tool to test the project we were working on.

Most of project at Air France is build using Java, Spring, and so. We have a internal tool which use an excel file to automate test and use selenium, http request etc. to test each aspect of the project.

My motivation was to take this use of the excel file to make the test comprehensive by functional people and make the best tool suite to test each aspect of Java, including jms, jdbc etc.
